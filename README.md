# UI Components & Credits

Some UI components used in this project were inspired by **[UIverse](https://uiverse.io/)**.
These include:
- **scroll indicator** by https://uiverse.io/ozgeozkaraa01/rare-termite-94
- **back to top button** by https://uiverse.io/ArturCodeCraft/black-chicken-8
- **Hamburger icon** by https://uiverse.io/Cevorob/good-wolverine-51

These components were **modified and customised** (such as colours, layout, animations, and sizing) to better match the overall design and theme of this website.

Full credit goes to the original creators on UIverse.
